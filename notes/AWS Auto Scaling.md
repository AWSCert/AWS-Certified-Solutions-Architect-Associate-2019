# AWS Auto Scaling

##### Q. What is AWS Auto Scaling?
AWS Auto Scaling is a new AWS service that helps you optimize the performance of your applications while lowering infrastructure costs by easily and safely scaling multiple AWS resources. It simplifies the scaling experience by allowing you to scale collections of related resources that support your application with just a few clicks. AWS Auto Scaling helps you configure consistent and congruent scaling policies across the full infrastructure stack backing your application. AWS Auto Scaling will automatically scale resources as needed to align to your selected scaling strategy, so you maintain performance and pay only for the resources you actually need.

##### Q. When should I use AWS Auto Scaling?

You should use AWS Auto Scaling if you have an application that uses one or more scalable resources and experiences variable load. A good example would be an e-commerce web application that receives variable traffic through the day. It follows a standard three tier architecture with Elastic Load Balancing for distributing incoming traffic, Amazon EC2 for the compute layer, and DynamoDB for the data layer. In this case, AWS Auto Scaling will scale one or more EC2 Auto Scaling groups and DynamoDB tables that are powering the application in response to the demand curve.


##### Q. When should I use AWS Auto Scaling vs. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling?

You should use AWS Auto Scaling to manage scaling for multiple resources across multiple services. AWS Auto Scaling lets you define dynamic scaling policies for multiple EC2 Auto Scaling groups or other resources using predefined scaling strategies. Using AWS Auto Scaling to configure scaling policies for all of the scalable resources in your application is faster than managing scaling policies for each resource via its individual service console. Itâ€™s also easier, as AWS Auto Scaling includes predefined scaling strategies that simplify the setup of scaling policies. You should also use AWS Auto Scaling if you want to create predictive scaling for EC2 resources.

You should use EC2 Auto Scaling if you only need to scale Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, or if you are only interested in maintaining the health of your EC2 fleet. You should also use EC2 Auto Scaling if you need to create or configure Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, or if you need to set up scheduled or step scaling policies (as AWS Auto Scaling supports only target tracking scaling policies).

EC2 Auto Scaling groups must be created and configured outside of AWS Auto Scaling, such as through the EC2 console, Auto Scaling API or via CloudFormation. AWS Auto Scaling can help you configure dynamic scaling policies for your existing EC2 Auto Scaling groups.


##### Q. When should I use AWS Auto Scaling vs. Auto Scaling for individual services?

You should use AWS Auto Scaling to manage scaling for multiple resources across multiple services. AWS Auto Scaling enables unified scaling for multiple resources, and has predefined guidance that helps make it easier and faster to configure scaling. If you prefer, you can instead choose to use the individual service consoles, Auto Scaling API, or Application Auto Scaling API to scale individual AWS services. You should also use the individual consoles or API if you want to setup step scaling policies or scheduled scaling, as AWS Auto Scaling creates target tracking scaling policies only. 


##### Q. What is Predictive Scaling?

Predictive Scaling is a feature of AWS Auto Scaling that looks at historic traffic patterns and forecasts them into the future to schedule changes in the number of EC2 instances at the appropriate times going forward. Predictive Scaling uses machine learning models to forecast daily and weekly patterns.

Auto Scaling enhanced with Predictive Scaling delivers faster, simpler, and more accurate capacity provisioning resulting in lower cost and more responsive applications. By predicting traffic changes, Predictive Scaling provisions EC2 instances in advance of changing traffic, making Auto Scaling faster and more accurate.
